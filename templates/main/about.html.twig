            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The **Cookbook** was founded on a simple principle: to preserve and share the classic, time-tested
                recipes that define home cooking. In a world of complicated trends, we focus on the fundamentals—dishes
                that are easy to follow, require accessible ingredients, and always deliver that comforting, familiar
                flavor. We're dedicated to being your reliable source for cooking, whether you're a beginner making your
                first soup or an experienced chef perfecting a family classic.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This digital Cookbook originated from a well-loved, handwritten binder passed down through generations.
                Our founder, **[Founder's Name/Conceptual Name]**, realized the need to digitize these precious
                instructions so they could be shared globally without losing the spirit of their original, simple
                execution. Since launching in **[Conceptual Year, e.g., 2018]**, we have expanded our collection, but
                our commitment to authenticity remains the same.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                We continuously test and refine every recipe on the site to ensure it works perfectly in your kitchen.
